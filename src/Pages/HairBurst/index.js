            In Seller-Interactive, we focus on optimizing our clients’ listings,
            thus increasing profits. Let’s take this specific case study and see
            how we increased the sales of our client in just a few weeks. Yes,
            you read that right. In just a short period, we were able to help
            our client double their sales by using a tested approach using
            holistic listing images, copies, and top-notch keyword analysis.

            A lot of Amazon sellers direct their resources on outside marketing,
            leaving them unaware of the opportunities to increase sales by
            simply optimizing their product pages. Most of them pick fad methods
            that get saturated pretty quickly, just like using ‘ManychatBots’ or
            hiring inexperienced freelancers that may get the job done but at a
            subpar level. The freelancer might use listing images that showcase
            products in free-stock backdrops making it look photoshopped.
            Another common mistake is when using repeated keywords that are not
            indexed in the A9 Algorithm. If they do make changes, the amazon
            sellers don’t perform any analysis on the customer and market
            response to the changes made. If you think you are not maximizing
            your resources, you are in luck because Seller-Interactive’s got
            your back.

        Initial Conditions

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 4 }}>
        The account we are going to analyze, and study is Hairburst. Initially,
        the product page only had 5 images which look unoptimized. The copies
        also look too short for my taste and it does not provide customers
        relevant information about the products.

        Focus on the Benefits
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 4 }}>
        Many sellers brand their products, such as "No Chemicals" or "No SLS.”
        They focus on what they ARE NOT, and they don't brand their products on
        what their products are. I've seen this mistake far too often. What you
        should is focus on what your product is. For example"No SLS” can be
        better translated to "Natural, so safe you can eat it" or "No Animal
        substances" can be short for "For Vegans." This is a subtle change, but
        it creates a higher impact with the product’s perceived value.

        Social Proof
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 4 }}>
        With the current trends on the internet, online reviews have emerged as
        one of the most reliable forms of social proofs. It allows brands to
        take advantage of the 1-5 Star Format, where customers leave their
        comments and validations. When customers look at the product pages, they
        initially look at the listing images THEN search for the 1 star reviews
        at the lower page. These are among the most significant contributors to
        lower conversion. Customers will read the reviews, but if they are
        bombarded with negative social proof (AKA negative reviews) they will
        lose interest in the product. Our job is to hook customers in the
        initial viewing of the listing images so that they don’t look for other
        products! .

        Influencer Marketing
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 4 }}>
        With the boom of social media influencers and artists, businesses must
        also shift to newer marketing models. One of these is influencer
        marketing. It may sound like a buzzword, but it is a hybrid of old and
        new marketing strategies. This is similar to celebrity endorsement in
        the sense that a famous individual will endorse a product and will give
        it external validation. Influencers or micro-influencers replace
        mainstream artists or celebrities since the younger generation (your
        target market) of the internet era relate more to influencers than
        celebrities.

        We have prepared a chart above that shows the difference we can make.
        You can see that the sales significantly improved and that the orders
        evidently increased. This may imply that the description and visuals
        caught the attention of the customer. Most consumers are hooked to our
        client’s products because the listing copies contain useful information,
        listing images are pleasing to the eye, and both are holistically sales
        effective.
