        Overcoming Seller Health Challenges
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
        Before Seller Interactive, Vortex Enterprise tried various Amazon
        consulting services but was unsuccessful in improving persistent seller
        health challenges. Despite their long-time presence in the marketplace,
        their seller health lacked the attention needed to be resolved.
        Consequently, it was taken down and delisted due to false copyright
        claims from various competitors.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
        The issue resulted in a significant decrease in revenue, and Amazon
        assessed their account health as 'At-Risk.' From there, the SI team was
        able to make changes towards improvement of Amazon seller health for
        Vortex Enterprise

        Managing Account Health with the Right Focus
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
        Seller Interactive implemented various methods to reinstate the 16
        delisted ASINs, which would contribute to the account's overall health.
        Before SI, the Account Health Rating was 'At-Risk.' The improvement of
        the account health was made possible through Vortex Enterprise and
        Seller Interactive's partnership by several approaches.

        1. Collect and Package Accurate Documentation:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 1, paddingLeft: 2 }}>
        The SI team worked, alongside Vortex Enterprise, to obtain accurate
        documents, i.e., brand registry/trademark, UPCs, and images of the
        products. This way, the information on Amazon and the contents of the
        appeals would not conflict. SI communicated consistently with Jun and
        his in-house team.

        2. Model and Create Frameworks for Professional Appeals:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 1, paddingLeft: 2 }}>
        After SI collected and finalized the appropriate documentation, SI
        created the Appeals and packaged them with the appointed documents to
        send to Amazon Seller Support. Overall, 16 appeals were completed and
        successfully sent to Amazon.

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3, fontWeight: 600 }}>
        3. Relist Each ASIN Following Amazon Guidelines:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 1, paddingLeft: 2 }}>
        While feedback from Amazon was pending, SI planned for ASIN relisting
        and educated Vortex Enterprise on the most reliable account health
        practices to avoid future issues. SI conducted a full audit to ensure
        there weren’t any violations in the content that would go against
        Amazon’s product guidelines.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
        Seller Interactives contributions alongside Vortex Enterprise resulted
        in remarkable improvement in Account Health Rating. Not only was account
        health in excellent condition, but the reinstatement also resulted in an
        overall sales increase.

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
        Based on the data, it is evident that having a healthy Amazon account
        and reinstated ASINs will significantly increase the presence and
        revenue generated on Amazon. Amazon is more likely to recognize that the
        listings are suitable and relevant to your customer’s needs, resulting
        in more traffic and higher sales potential.
