            This is the first time that SoLo Nutrition has ever collaborated
            with an independent marketing firm. The brand, which has 15 ASINs on
            Amazon, has been selling in the Canadian marketplace for six years
            now. Ever since, it has been managing all mar-keting processes
            internally. For over 10 months since June 2019, it has not worked
            with any Amazon experts until the SI team took over.

            Then, we went on to further elaborate on the benefits of their

            images that showed models enjoying the health bars in various
            situations and settings. Unlike their previous image that showed
            only the product, our copywriting and graphic design team
            collaborated to create the most ideal product listing that focused
            on the brandâ€™s target market and benefits.

            To advertise SoLo Nutrition, we combined the following strategic

              Executed thorough market analysis to identify immediate areas for

            <li>

            <li>Launched brand specific keyword campaigns</li>
            <li>
              Developed promotional strategy to increase sales and conversion
              rates
            </li>
            <li>
              Built effective, low cost advertising campaigns to increase

            account managers and heads who reviewed it several times.

            This step is necessary for ensuring that every detail of the copy
            and images comply with Amazonâ€™s policies and of course, the high SI
            standards of quality.
